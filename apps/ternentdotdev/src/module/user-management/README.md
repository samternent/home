## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### `useUserProfiles.js`
The main composable that provides all user management functionality:

```javascript
const {
  // State
  profiles,
  myProfile,
  currentUserProfile,
  isLoading,
  
  // Actions
  saveMyProfile,
  shareProfileWith,
  exportMyProfile,
  syncToSolid,
  
  // Computed
  profilesSharedWithMe,
  profilesSharedByMe
} = useUserProfiles();
```

#### `UserProfileManager.vue`
The main UI component for profile management with tabs for:
- **My Profile**: View and edit personal information

- **Backup & Sync**: Export, import, and Solid pod synchronization

#### `SecureKeySharing.vue`
A specialized component for sharing cryptographic keys securely:
- Step-by-step wizard interface
- Risk assessment and warnings
- Encryption for secure transfer
- Expiration and usage controls

## üîê Security Features

### 1. **Encryption at Rest**
- Private keys are stored encrypted in local storage
- Sensitive profile data is encrypted before storage
- Uses industry-standard AES encryption

### 2. **Secure Key Sharing**
- All shared keys are encrypted using the recipient's public key
- Support for expiration dates and one-time use
- Clear warnings for high-risk operations

### 3. **Access Control**
- Granular permission system
- Identity-based access control
- Audit trail for all sharing activities

### 4. **Data Integrity**
- Cryptographic signatures for all profile updates
- Hash-based integrity checking
- Tamper detection mechanisms

## üöÄ Usage

### Setting Up User Management

1. **Provide the service** in your main application:

```javascript
// In your main route component
import { provideUserProfiles } from "@/module/user-management/useUserProfiles";

// Provide at the app level
provideUserProfiles();
```

2. **Use in components**:

```javascript
import { useUserProfiles } from "@/module/user-management/useUserProfiles";

const { saveMyProfile, shareProfileWith } = useUserProfiles();
```

### Creating a Profile

```javascript
await saveMyProfile({
  name: "John Doe",
  bio: "Software developer passionate about privacy",
  email: "john@example.com",
  website: "https://johndoe.dev",
  socialLinks: {
    github: "johndoe",
    twitter: "@johndoe"
  }
});
```

### Sharing a Profile

```javascript
await shareProfileWith(
  "recipient-identity-key",
  null, // Use default profile data
  "contact" // Access level: basic, contact, or trusted
);
```

### Secure Key Sharing

```javascript
// Open the key sharing component
<SecureKeySharing 
  :open="showKeySharing"
  @update:open="showKeySharing = $event"
  @keyShared="handleKeyShared"
/>
```

## üåê Solid Pod Integration

The system integrates seamlessly with Solid pods for decentralized storage:

### Profile Backup
```javascript
// Backup profile to Solid pod
await syncToSolid();
```

### Profile Restore
```javascript
// Restore from Solid pod
await loadFromSolid("profile-backup.json");
```

## üìä Data Structures

### Profile Data
```javascript
{
  identity: "public-key-pem",
  name: "User Name",
  bio: "User bio",
  email: "user@example.com",
  avatar: "https://avatar-url.com/image.jpg",
  socialLinks: {
    twitter: "@username",
    github: "username",
    linkedin: "username"
  },
  preferences: {
    theme: "auto",
    notifications: true,
    publicProfile: true
  },
  lastUpdated: "2025-06-28T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Key Share Record
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  sharedBy: "sharer-identity",
  sharedWith: "recipient-identity",
  keyTypes: ["identityPublic", "encryptionPublic"],
  encryptedData: "encrypted-key-package",
  expiresAt: "2025-07-28T12:00:00.000Z",
  oneTimeUse: false,
  isActive: true,
  sharedAt: "2025-06-28T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```
