PixPax is a collection of pixel stickers.

You open packs.  
You discover what’s inside.  
You keep the ones you like.

Some are simple.  
Some are rare.  
Some feel special the moment you see them.

Each sticker is made from tiny pixels, inspired by old games and trading cards — small, playful, and full of character.

## Opening Packs

Every PixPax pack is a surprise.

You don’t choose what you get.  
You don’t know what’s coming.

That’s part of the fun.

Sometimes you get something ordinary.  
Sometimes you get something that feels _just right_.  
Sometimes you get something you’ll never forget.

## How the Stickers Are Made

PixPax stickers aren’t drawn one by one.

They’re **generated**.

Each sticker is created by a set of rules — like a recipe — that decides how the pixels come together. The same rules apply to every pack, but the outcomes are always different.

> It’s like shaking a kaleidoscope.  
> The pieces are the same, the patterns never are.

No one sits there designing a “rare” sticker.  
Rarity emerges naturally from how the pixels combine.

## What Makes Them Real

Each PixPax sticker is backed by a bit of careful maths that makes it:

- **Real**
- **Unique**
- **Provably yours**

This works like an invisible stamp that records what the sticker is, when it was created, and who owns it.

Even if the image is copied, the _original_ can always be recognised.

## Why That Matters

Because collecting feels better when it’s fair.

Rarity actually means something.  
Ownership isn’t just a promise.  
What you collect stays consistent over time.

The rules don’t change depending on who you are — they apply equally to every pack, every sticker, every collector.

## A Living System

PixPax isn’t finished.

The rules that generate stickers can evolve over time — becoming more expressive, more surprising, more beautiful — while still respecting what already exists.

Early stickers remain early stickers.  
New ones explore new spaces.

Like a growing language, not a reset.

## In the End

PixPax is about small moments:

Opening a pack  
Watching pixels come together  
Finding something that feels like it was meant for you

Tiny pixels.  
Generated with care.  
Built to last.

That’s PixPax.
