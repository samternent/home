PixPax is a collection of pixel cards.

You open packs.  
You scan codes.  
You collect what matters to you.

Some come from weekly drops.  
Some are given by friends.  
Some are issued for a moment and never again.

Every card is small.  
Every card is deliberate.  
Every card belongs to a series — issued by someone.

## Opening Packs

Some collections release packs on a schedule.

You don’t choose what’s inside.  
You don’t know what’s coming.

That’s part of the fun.

A pack might contain something you expected.  
Or something you didn’t even know you wanted.  
Sometimes you find something you’ll never forget.

## Redeeming Codes

Some collections don’t use scheduled drops at all.

They live in the real world.

A friend hands you a printed code.  
A page in a small homemade book.  
A card someone made for their own series.

You scan.  
You collect.

One code. One issuance.

No tricks.  
No duplicates from the same code.

Just a small, verifiable moment.

## How the Cards Are Made

PixPax cards are built on a simple grid.

Tiny pixels.  
A fixed format.  
Clear rules.

The system defines the canvas.  
The issuer defines the collection.

Sometimes that’s PixPax.  
Sometimes it’s a child making dragons.  
Sometimes it’s someone you know.

The format stays consistent.  
The meaning comes from who issued it.

## What Makes Them Real

Each PixPax card is backed by a bit of careful maths that makes it:

- **Official**
- **Verifiable**
- **Provably yours**

Every card carries a signature that proves it was genuinely issued and hasn’t been altered.

Even if the image is copied, the _original_ can always be recognised.

## Why That Matters

Because collecting feels better when it’s fair.

A code can only be redeemed once.  
A pack follows the same rules for everyone.  
An issuer can’t quietly change the past.

Ownership isn’t just a promise.  
It’s recorded.

The rules apply equally — whether you’re collecting a public series or a set your friend made.

---

## A Growing World

PixPax isn’t just one collection.

It’s a platform for collections.

Some are public.  
Some are unlisted.  
Some are discovered only when you redeem your first code.

Early cards remain early cards.  
New ones build on what came before.

Nothing resets.  
It just grows.

---

## In the End

PixPax is about small, real moments:

Opening a pack  
Scanning a code  
Collecting something someone chose to issue

Tiny pixels.  
Clear rules.  
Shared meaning.

Built to be simple.  
Built to last.

That’s PixPax.
