# üî• Ternent.dev: Encrypted Rebellion Against Corporate Surveillance

## ‚ö° Manifesto

**Your data, your rules. Collaborate dangerously.**

Ternent.dev is a **100% free, open-source decentralized collaboration platform** built for rebels, activists, journalists, hackers, and anyone who refuses to surrender their digital sovereignty to corporate overlords.

**Core Rebellion**: We reject the false choice between convenience and privacy. While Big Tech surveils your every keystroke and Web3 projects peddle expensive tokens, we deliver **real cryptographic security** and **actual decentralization** - completely free, forever.

**Punk Ethos**: This isn't enterprise software with a rebellious coat of paint. This is **encrypted resistance** - built offline-first, owned by users, and impossible to shut down because there are no servers to seize.

**Unique Architecture**: **Completely offline-first** - all functionality works without internet connection. Solid pod synchronization is optional for backup and sharing, but the core rebellion operates entirely in your browser using local storage.

**Key Differentiator**: While others talk about decentralization, we actually built it. Your collaboration rooms exist on your device, encrypted with your keys, synced to your chosen storage. No corporate middleman, no surveillance, no bullshit.

## üéØ Target Rebels & Use Cases

### Primary Resistance Movements:
- **Activist Groups**: Organize campaigns with cryptographic proof and zero surveillance
- **Grassroots Communities**: Local organizing without corporate platform dependency
- **Independent Journalists**: Source protection with unbreachable audit trails
- **Hackers & Privacy Advocates**: Tool-building and coordination in secure environments
- **Artists & Creators**: Collaborative projects without platform censorship or data harvesting
- **Whistleblowers & Dissidents**: Secure collaboration in oppressive environments

### Rebellious Value Propositions:
- **For Activists**: "Organize without fear - your movement data belongs to you"
- **For Journalists**: "Protect your sources with cryptographic integrity"
- **For Hackers**: "Build the resistance with tools that can't be compromised"
- **For Communities**: "Coordinate locally, own globally - no corporate overlord required"

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Rebellion Architecture

### Revolutionary Principles:
1. **Offline-First Liberation**: Full functionality without internet - works in basements, protests, anywhere
2. **Cryptographic Sovereignty**: Every action cryptographically signed and verifiable
3. **True Decentralization**: Data lives where YOU choose, not where corporations profit
4. **Radical Usability**: Enterprise-grade security with activist-friendly interfaces

### Resistance Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite (fast, responsive, no corporate tracking)
- **Security**: Blockchain-inspired immutable records with cryptographic integrity
- **Encryption**: Age encryption + Web Crypto API (NSA-resistant, browser-native)
- **Storage**: **Local-first browser storage** + optional Solid pod sync (your choice, always)
- **Identity**: Public/private key cryptography (be your own certificate authority)
- **Distribution**: Static files, no servers to raid or shut down

### Liberation Components:

#### 1. **Cryptographic Resistance Engine** (`packages/blockchain/`, `packages/proof-of-work/`)
- **Rust/WebAssembly** performance (compiled resistance)
- **TypeScript implementation** with SHA-256 integrity (browser-native security)
- **Immutable audit trails** (impossible to forge or delete)
- **Digital signatures** for everything (cryptographic proof of authenticity)

#### 2. **Identity Liberation System** (`packages/identity/`, `packages/encrypt/`)
- **Self-sovereign identity** using Web Crypto API (no central authority)
- **Age encryption** for sensitive communications (modern, secure, open-source)
- **Local key management** (your keys never leave your device)
- **Pseudonymous operation** (identity privacy by design)

#### 3. **Collaboration Resistance Tools** (`packages/ledger/`)
- **Tamper-proof records** with cryptographic integrity
- **Permission-based access** with encrypted key sharing
- **Multi-format export** (JSON, compressed, encrypted - your choice)
- **Conflict resolution** for distributed organizing

#### 4. **Anti-Surveillance Storage** (`apps/ternentdotdev/src/module/solid/`)
- **Optional Solid pod backup** (your pod, your rules, your choice of provider)
- **Multi-provider support** (never depend on a single service)
- **Manual sync operations** (conscious choice, not automatic surveillance)
- **Cross-device coordination** without corporate intermediaries

#### 5. **User Liberation Interface** (`apps/ternentdotdev/`)
- **Clean, minimal design** (no dark patterns, no tracking, no bullshit)
- **Real-time status indicators** (transparency in all operations)
- **Mobile-responsive** (organize from anywhere)
- **Accessibility-focused** (resistance for everyone)

## üîê Security Philosophy: Crypto-Anarchist Grade

### Zero-Trust, User-Sovereign Model:
- **Users control ALL keys**: Identity and encryption keys never leave your device
- **Cryptographic proof**: Every action digitally signed and independently verifiable
- **Immutable records**: Once created, records cannot be altered or deleted by anyone
- **No central authority**: No servers to compromise, no admins to coerce

### Resistance-Grade Implementation:
- **ECDSA P-256 signatures**: Military-grade authentication for all records
- **Age encryption**: Modern, secure encryption for sensitive communications
- **SHA-256 integrity**: Immediate detection of any data tampering
- **Client-side everything**: All crypto operations in your browser, not their servers

### Revolutionary Access Model:
- **Granular permissions**: Share exactly what you choose, with whom you choose
- **Encrypted key distribution**: Access shared via recipient's public key only
- **Audit trail for access**: All permission changes recorded and verifiable
- **Time-based permissions**: Temporary access that automatically expires

### True Digital Sovereignty:
- **Local-first storage**: Your data lives on your device first, always
- **Optional cloud backup**: Use Solid pods or any provider you trust
- **Complete offline operation**: Full functionality without internet
- **Universal portability**: Export everything, anytime, in any format
