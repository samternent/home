**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities directly on the public repository. Instead, please follow our responsible disclosure policy.

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, we kindly request you to notify us immediately by sending an email to [sam.ternent@gmail.com](mailto:sam.ternent@gmail.com). We will acknowledge your email within 72 hours and work to address the issue as soon as possible.

Please provide the following details in your report:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and the affected areas.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure, and we greatly appreciate your efforts in reporting security vulnerabilities to us privately. To encourage responsible reporting, we commit to the following:

- We will respond to your report within 72 hours to acknowledge its receipt.
- We will work with you to understand and validate the reported vulnerability.
- We will keep you informed of our progress and expected timelines for addressing the issue.
- We will give credit to the reporter in the acknowledgments section of the repository once the issue is resolved (if you wish to be credited).

## Scope

Please note that this security policy only applies to security vulnerabilities related to this repository. For non-security-related issues, you can report them through the standard issue tracker.

## Severity Classification

When reporting a vulnerability, you may classify its severity based on the following guidelines:

- **Critical**: Vulnerabilities that can lead to remote code execution or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **High**: Vulnerabilities that can lead to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or other serious security issues.
- **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that have limited impact or require specific conditions to be exploited.
- **Low**: Minor vulnerabilities with limited security impact.
